# DUBBD

I copied several folders from [zarf-package-big-bang](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf-package-big-bang) because...
- DUBBD doesn't yet do k3s (had to modify istio.yaml)
- because ^ I have to `zarf package create`

Once DUBBD supports k3s out of the box, I will only need certs and zarf-config.yaml
